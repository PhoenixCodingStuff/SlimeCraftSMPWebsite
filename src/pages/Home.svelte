            <h1>What is SlimeCraftSMP?</h1>
                <p>
                    <br>SlimeCraftSMP is a <b>Public Minecraft Server</b> which attempts to make Minecraft a bit more fun for people who are bored for Vanilla Minecraft.</br>
                    <br>It introduces many aspects from mods like enchants terrain etc. <i>I will not waste your time with all features and leave it that for later.</i></br>
                    <br>Now you maybe wondering how to join the server on your 10 year old PC... Do not worry , we got you covered!</br>
                    <br>All the work is done by custom plugins[Some by me , Some by others]! That means you do not need a single mod.</br>
                    <br>This was done considering many people like me would have old PCs and would not be willing to download mods because of performance reasons.</br>
                    <br>Now your next question would be - What about the people who do not have a PC themself? Do not worry , we got you covered too!</br>
                    <br>We allow bedrock connections too! That means you could play on the server even on your mobiles or consoles or xbox etc.</br>
                    <br>Also unlike other servers we have <b>zero</b> Pay-To-Win aspects. <i>So your parents need not worry about you emptying their credit cards.</i></br>
                </p>
