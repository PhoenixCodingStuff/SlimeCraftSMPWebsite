    <h1>What is SlimeCraftSMP?</h1>
        <p>
            SlimeCraftSMP is a <b>Public Minecraft Server</b> which attempts to make Minecraft a bit more fun for people who are bored for Vanilla Minecraft.
            It introduces many aspects from mods like enchants terrain etc. I will not waste your time with all features and leave that for later.
            <br/><br/>
            Now you maybe wondering how to join the server on your 10 year old PC... Do not worry , we got you covered!
            All the work is done by custom plugins[Some by me , Some by others]! That means you <b>do not need a single mod</b>.
            This was done considering many people like me would have old PCs and would not be willing to download mods because of performance reasons.
            <br/><br/>
            Now your next question might be - What about the people who do not have a PC themself? Do not worry , we got you covered too!
            We allow bedrock connections too! That means you could play on the server <b>even on your mobiles or consoles or xbox</b> etc.
            <br/><br/>
            Also unlike other servers we have <b>zero</b> Pay-To-Win aspects. <i>So your parents need not worry about you emptying their credit cards.</i>
        </p>
